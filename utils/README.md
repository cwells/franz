What's here
===========
Syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3. My first attempt at this as well, so it's quite basic support.

On Linux:
`cp Franz.sublime-syntax Franz.tmPreferences ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/`

If you're not on Linux, check the [Sublime Text documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/syntax.html).
